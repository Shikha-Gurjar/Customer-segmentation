Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a customer base into groups. In each of these groups the individuals are similar to each other in some ways. This practice allows a business to create a group specific campaign or digital advertisement. This not only increases the effectiveness of the business's marketing efforts, it helps in reducing the marketing costs by reducing spends on certain audience groups that might react differently to a campaign. Segmentation also enables businesses to focus marketing activities more on certain platforms based on the characteristics of the segments.
